## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Came to know that Mobile-first workflow can be very fast and can reduce a lot of headache.
I had used much relative units in this project.


### Continued development

Not comfortable with position property, will focus on it in next project.
